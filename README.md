Related stuff from my Amiga scene era (mostly from past century ...)

**Featuring :**
- 68K asssembler (Devpac, K-Seka or AsmOne)
- Nice $load and $org
- direct banging of registers
- illegal ops
- no cache aware
- stunning low-res pixels
- 8 bits sound
- "code like there will be no tomorrow"
- no shaders

Enjoy ;)
